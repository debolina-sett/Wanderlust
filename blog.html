			<h1>Blog 3 : NORWAY <i>- " I saw the northern lights !! "</i></h1>
			<div class="div3"></div>
			<p>
				A lot of people skip visiting Norway because of how expensive it is. It’s true that Norway is not a budget destination. Even the most frugal person will have a hard time saving money here.

				<p>However, Norway is so amazingly beautiful with incredible people that it’s worth paying the extra money or doing bare-bones activities while here. The Norwegians are wonderful people; everyone speaks fluent English, and the sheer beauty of this country is too compelling to ignore. There is nothing like sailing around the fjords in the north.

				<p>And, thankfully, there’s a lot of free outdoor activities in Norway that can fill your days without emptying your wallet. It’s not easy to visit Norway on a budget but it’s not impossible.

			<h2>Blog 2 : JAPAN <i> - " Anime is real, Japan made me believe !! "</i></h2>
			<div class="div2"></div>
			<p>
				Japan is one of the most amazing, beautiful, and friendly countries in the world. From bustling Tokyo and zen-like Kyoto all the way to laid-back Okinawa and wintery Hokkaido, Japan is a high-tech world mixed with the politeness and respect of their past.

				<p>Honestly, I love traveling and backpacking Japan.

				<p>It was a life-long dream to go there and, when I finally did, it lived up to all my expectations.

				<p>Japan has mouth-watering food, majestic temples and shrines, zen gardens, lush national parks, and a rich historic culture. It’s a wonderful place and, while it may be an expensive country to visit, there are plenty of ways to make this country an affordable place to visit.


				<p>I was actually shocked how easy it was to travel Japan on a budget!

				<p>Backpacking or traveling Japan isn’t as expensive or difficult as you think. It’s one of those great myths of travel that Japan has to be expensive or hard to get around.

				<p>That’s not true.

				<p>And everyone here is super friendly and helpful. Everyone here is just so excited to have guests and are lovely, lovely people!

			<h3>Blog 1 : MEXICO <i> - "What's better than tacos ?<p style="text-align:center;"> Tacos in Mexico !! "</i></p> </h3>
			<div class="div1"></div>
			<p>
				While many people will visit Mexico for its incredible resorts and its big tourist centers like Tulum, Cancun, Punta Cana, or Cozumel, too often travelers ignore the rest of the country.
				<p>
				Each region in Mexico is incredibly diverse: Central Mexico is home to culture capitals like the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan and the bustling metropolis of Mexico City; the south has the perfect beaches of Quintana Roo, and the north has the forested mountains of the Sierra Norte just beyond Oaxaca (and so much more).
				<p>
				Mexico is an incredible country to backpack around, drive through, or just vacation in. There’s a ton of stuff to do here, and the locals are some of the friendliest people on the planet.
				<p>
				From Mayan ruins and lush jungles to pristine Pacific Coast surf beaches and the seediness of Tijuana — and everything in between! Discover Mexico City’s vibrant energy and artsy, graffiti-filled neighborhoods, learn about the Mayan civilization at Chichen Itza, and gorge yourself on delicious tacos, tostadas, and tamales (to name a few items from Mexico’s very long list of traditional dishes).
